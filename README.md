# Multithreaded Image Upload App in Flutter

This Flutter app demonstrates how to use multithreading to efficiently upload images to a database. Multithreading allows you to perform time-consuming tasks like image uploading in the background without blocking the user interface.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: Utilizes Dart's native multithreading capabilities to handle image uploads concurrently, improving app responsiveness.
- **Image Selection**: Allows users to select images from their device for uploading.
- **Database Integration**: Demonstrates integration with a database (referenced in [Database Reference](#database-reference)) for storing uploaded images.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilizes Dart's async/await for handling asynchronous operations efficiently.
